# World Happiness Data Analysis (2007-2017)

This project analyzes the World Happiness Report data from 2007 to 2017. The primary goals were to perform exploratory data analysis, visualize global trends, and apply machine learning models to predict happiness scores.

[cite_start]This project was developed as part of the curriculum for the Bachelor's of Science in Mathematics at BoÄŸaziÃ§i University[cite: 6, 7].

## ðŸš€ Project Pipeline & Key Activities

The project was structured as an end-to-end data science workflow:

* [cite_start]**Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and prepared the raw dataset for analysis[cite: 20].
* [cite_start]**Feature Engineering:** Engineered relevant features from the existing data to improve analysis and model accuracy[cite: 20].
* [cite_start]**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Performed a deep exploratory analysis to uncover initial patterns[cite: 20].
* [cite_start]**Visualization:** Analyzed global trends and the correlations between happiness and key factors like GDP, life expectancy, freedom, and corruption indices using time-series visualization[cite: 21].
* [cite_start]**Machine Learning:** Applied machine learning models to predict happiness scores based on the analyzed factors[cite: 22].

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

[cite_start]This project leveraged technologies and concepts from my academic coursework, such as "Python for Data Science & AI" [cite: 11] [cite_start]and "Machine Learning Methods"[cite: 11].

* [cite_start]**Primary Language:** Python [cite: 3]
* **Data Analysis & ML:** *(Please add the specific libraries you used, e.g., Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)*
* [cite_start]**Visualization:** *(Please add the libraries/tools you used, e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Power BI [cite: 3])*

## ðŸ“Š Key Analyses & Findings

* [cite_start]In-depth analysis of the correlation between happiness scores and metrics such as GDP, life expectancy, and corruption indices[cite: 21].
* [cite_start]Time-series visualization of how global happiness trends have evolved[cite: 21].
* [cite_start]Development of a predictive model for happiness scores[cite: 22].
